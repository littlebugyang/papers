# Overview
### 0. The code is based on the paper about the semiboost. I only have realized the part of the sb-svm, which is one of the algorithms that the paper has studied on.
### 1. Dataset
The name of the dataset is **WDBC**.
It's downloaded from *https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)*
Even though its name doesn't entirely fit the name **WDBC** ...
### 2. Steps
It's been briefly described in the paper in the form of figures.
And I have left comments in both English and Chinese in the code. Mainly in *main.py*.
### 3. Results
The accuracy presented in paper is about 88%.
However, I have got the accuracy of 92% !!!!!
Yes, it doesn't mean a lot, since I have only run this experiment twice.
